🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

Period Covered: Nov 2023 – Aug 2026Tool Used: SQL (SQLite)Dataset: Retail transactional data including date, customer demographics, product category, and sales figures.

🔍 Project Overview:

This project explores a retail business’s sales trends, product performance, and customer demographics from late 2023 to mid-2026 using SQL-based analysis. The business launched in November 2023, with limited activity in its first months. The real operational insight begins from 2024 onward — where performance, patterns, and issues become more meaningful.

💡 Key Findings:

🗓️ Time-Based Sales Trends:

2023: Limited data; not representative of normal operations.

2024: Strong growth year with a +77.52% increase in average monthly sales compared to 2023.

2025: Continued growth with a +5.26% increase.

2026: -32.06% decline in average monthly sales (data through August only), showing early signs of a downward shift in business momentum.

Peak Sales Months: January, March, and November stand out as high-performing months. March has the highest average sales across all years.

Slower Months: May, July, and December typically underperform.

Volatility observed across all categories.

Major spikes: Beauty in Dec 2023 (+1414%), Clothing in Aug 2024 (+663%), Electronics in Dec 2023 (+21833%)

Major drops: Often follow peak months, suggesting possible overstocking, demand saturation, or seasonal effects.

Risk (Sales Volatility):

👥 Customer Demographics:

By Gender:

Female customers consistently contributed higher sales across all categories.

Particularly strong in Beauty and Clothing.

By Age Group:

Beauty: Highest sales from 45–54 and 35–44 groups.

Clothing: Peaks in the 25–34 age group.

Electronics: Strongest in the 55–64 group, but shows broad appeal across age ranges.

⚠️ Business Concern:

Although 2024 and 2025 reflected a healthy growth trajectory, 2026 (up to August) shows a clear decline in monthly sales across all three categories — a red flag.

This raises a potential business problem:

"Why are all three categories experiencing a downturn in 2026 despite two years of strong performance?"

Possible causes may include:

External market conditions (e.g., economic shifts, competition)

Product saturation

Decreased marketing effectiveness

Supply chain or inventory issues

This analysis lays the groundwork for further investigation, perhaps through qualitative data (e.g., customer feedback, market reports) or additional quantitative metrics (e.g., returns, discounts, ad spend).
